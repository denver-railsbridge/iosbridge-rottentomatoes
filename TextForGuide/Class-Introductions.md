## Class Introductions
### Instructor(s) - Introduce Yourself
1. Your Name.
1. Where you work?
1. How you got into iOS?
1. Why are you volunteering your time to teach?
	* This is probably the more important question
	* You’re spending your free Saturday to help underserved members of the tech community.
	* Its really important to think about why you’re doing this and being able to articulate it.

### Students - Gather Some Basic Information
1. Name
1. Previous Programming Experience
	* Students will usually be overly humble here. Don’t be afraid   to probe further.
1. Reason they’re here.
	* Connecting with a student’s desire to learn is key to getting them to the next step of learning.
	* After a single day of learning iOS, no one will know the entire framework/platform.
	* Its important to connect with the students reason to learn in order to guide them to next steps.

### Set Expectations
1. In a 1 day workshop no one could possibly learn all of iOS. Its a huge framework.
	* The only way to learn iOS to continue learning on your own after the workshop.
1. Objective C is probably the language that will be used in the workshops. That said, challenge students to go through this curriculum again in Objective C and/or Swift at a later date.
	* That will be a good “Next Step” for after this workshop.
1. While the classes should be grouped based on knowledge level, there will always be a diversity of experience with programming.  Do your best to gauge the experience level of the class based on the questions answered in the previous section.
	* Note that inexperienced students may be less likely to ask questions for fear of seeming “dumb.” Be on the look out for this and engage the student directly.
	* Just as an anecdote, when I started iOS, I had no idea what an array or a dictionary were. So be wary when throwing around “simple” programming terms.

### Beer Goggles
1. While going through the curriculum there will almost certainly be a lot of questions. It is a common trap to spend a lot of time answering questions and then not being able to make it through the curriculum.
1. Use your best judgement on which questions to answer, which ones will be answered later and which ones to avoid (as answering them may only confuse more)
	* On the whiteboard, write down questions to be answered later. This will reassure students and aid your memory later in the workshop.
1. Don’t be afraid to ask students to use their “Beer Goggles.” Beer goggles are something that blurs your vision a little bit while looking at the code. You may not know exactly what every line does but you get the gist of what is going on. 

### Take Breaks
* Remember to take breaks occasionally. This stuff is pretty intense and 6 hours is a long time to be learning new things. Its probably a good idea to take a break in-between each section.
